$OVERVIEW_HEADER$=Serv-U Web Client Overview

$OVERVIEW_INTRO$::
The Serv-U Web Client is an HTTP-based file transfer client available for use by all Users on a properly licensed Serv-U File Server.  The Web Client is a perfect
solution for novice computer users and organizations with a need to provide a simple method of transferring a few files between your users.  Because it uses
the HTTP protocol to communicate with Serv-U, the Web Client avoids some of the headaches associated with using the FTP protocol in a secured environment
or through the limited support of FTP in today's common web browsers.

The  Web Client is capable of enabling users to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, including:
::END

$OVERVIEW_TASKS$::
Access your files from anywhere using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) from within your browser.
Transfer files to and from your File Server, including creating and deleting directories.
View remote images as thumbnails generated on-the-fly to conserve bandwidth and increase transfer speed.
Easily share photo albums using the built-in Slideshow feature.
Play Audio and Video files in the built-in Media Player.
Provide access to the File Server in <strong>eleven</strong> different supported languages.
::END
$OVERVIEW_LOGIN_PARAMS$=URL login and auto load parameters

$OVERVIEW_LOGIN_PARAMS_TXT$::
The Web Client offers the ability to send login credentials and special load parameters in the URL pointing to Serv-U File Server. Below is the list of 
parameters that can be added to the URL.

::END

$OVERVIEW_LIMITATIONS$::
The Web Client is intended to easily enable basic file transfer functionality on the broadest platform available - the standard Web browser.  However, it
is not intended to be a wholesale replacement for a full-featured FTP client.  If you're looking for an enterprise level solution that offers a full-featured
file transfer client to your users, then <strong>FTP Voyager JV</strong> is available to meet your needs.  With FTP Voyager JV, you still get easy deployment
and access configuration of the client through HTTP, but its basis on the Java platform enables the following features that are not available in the Web
Client:
::END

$OVERVIEW_LIMIT_LIST$::
Concurrently upload multiple files.
Download files while an upload is in progress.
Download a directory and its entire contents.
A traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on our award-winning $LINK_FV_HOMEPAGE$ client.
Side-by-side views of the remote and local file systems.
Multiple different file system views, (e.g., list, icons, details, thumbnails).
Maintain original file dates and times after file transfer.
"Move" files and folders between the remote and local file systems.
Platform specific display themes to ensure a uniform appearance on the platform of choice.
::END

$OVERVIEW_FVJV_INFO$::
To enable <strong>FTP Voyager JV</strong>, a supported license must be purchased for the File Server.  Once enabled, FTP Voyager JV is available to all Users
of the File Server that have installed the Java Runtime Environment on their system.  For more information on <strong>FTP Voyager JV</strong>, visit the

<!-- String table for Help-Image-Features -->
$IMAGES_HEADER$=Thumbnails, Slideshows & Media Player
$IMAGES_HEADER_TXT$::
The Web Client, combined with advanced features in Serv-U, is a perfect platform for sharing photos with friends, family, or clients.  Using advanced
on-the-fly compression techniques, the Web Client can request a custom sized thumbnail image for virtually any type of image file.  This thumbnail image
is generated by the server upon receiving the request and sent back to the client.  In this way, you can view a smaller version of an image file in a fraction
of the time it would take to download the entire file and open it up locally.  This also minimizes the amount of bandwidth used by the server to send these
image files.

The Web Client supports two image viewing modes:  thumbnails and slideshows.  Slideshows
can be viewed when in either the detailed or thumbnail view mode.
::END

$IMAGES_THUMBNAILS$=Thumbnails
$IMAGES_THUMBNAILS_TXT$::
The thumbnail view replaces the detailed directory listing with one that allows a thumbnail image to be displayed for each file.  If the file isn't of a
supported image type, then the appropriate icon for the file type is displayed instead.  While in thumbnail view mode, a set of buttons appears below each
thumbnail that replaces the standard action buttons that are usually found below the directory listing.  These buttons let you <strong>Open</strong>,
<strong>Download</strong>, <strong>Rename</strong>, and <strong>Delete</strong> files and folders like normal.  For image files, there is an additional option
available to preview the image.
::END

$IMAGES_THUMB_SIZE$=Thumbnail Size
$IMAGES_THUMB_SIZE_TXT$::
The size of each image thumbnail can be customized from the <strong>Thumbnail Size</strong> drop-down box.  Five sizes are offered to help you find a balance
between the size of the thumbnails and the time it takes to retrieve them.  While the available sizes are displayed as square values, the actual aspect ratio
of the image is preserved when creating a thumbnail to avoid distorting the original image.
::END

$IMAGES_THUMB_PREVIEW$=Preview Image
$IMAGES_THUMB_PREVIEW_TXT$::
Images can be previewed in both the thumbnail and detailed view mode.  An image that is previewed is displayed in a new dialog as if in a slideshow, however it
is paused on the previewed image.  Images are shown at a maximum width of 600 pixels.  If the previewed image is smaller than this size, then the image is shown
using its actual dimensions.  While previewing an image, a slideshow can be started by clicking the appropriate buttons located above the image.  For more
information on slideshows, continue reading.
::END

$IMAGES_SLIDESHOWS$=Slideshows
$IMAGES_SLIDESHOWS_TXT$::
Slideshows are a way to automatically preview the images contained in the current directory.  While viewing an image in slideshow mode, standard actions can be
performed on that file including <strong>Download</strong>, <strong>Rename</strong>, and <strong>Delete</strong> by clicking the appropriate button below the
image.
::END

$IMAGES_SLIDE_CONTROL$=Controlling a Slideshow
$IMAGES_SLIDE_CONTROL_TXT$::
The slideshow can be controlled manually using the buttons at the top of the slideshow dialog.  From left to right, the controls go to the previous image,
pause, start, and go to the next image in the slideshow, respectively.  Next to these controls is a counter showing the position of the current image along
with the total number of images in the slideshow.

The speed at which the images are displayed in the slideshow can be controlled using the slider at the bottom of the dialog.  Adjusting the slider to the left
towards <strong>Slow</strong> causes the images to be advanced at a slower pace.  Adjusting the slider towards <strong>Fast</strong> increases this pace.  On
some servers, a loading image may be displayed when advancing to the next image if the current pace is faster than the server is capable of generating the
slideshow image.

When you are finished viewing the slideshow, use the <strong>Close</strong> button to dismiss the slideshow dialog.
::END

$IMAGES_SLIDESHOWS$=Slideshows
$IMAGES_SLIDESHOWS_TXT$::

change to the previous or next media file in the current directory.  Once the media file has been played, the Media Player does not automatically move 
on to the next media file.

To play multiple audio files in succession, you must use the "Play List" option. When utilizing this feature, the controls in the appropriate media player 
plug-in can be used to change the current track.  While streaming a playlist from Serv-U, the download, delete, and rename actions are hidden.
