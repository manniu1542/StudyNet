$HEAD_LAYOUT_MAIN$=Application Overview

$DESC_LAYOUT_MAIN$::
The user interface of FTP Voyager JV makes it easier than ever to navigate a file system.  By using a familiar and simple layout
users can quickly begin to navigate through their file system.  A significant addition to the layout is the introduction of the
"$LINK_DOCKING_FRAMEWORK$".  The "docking framework" allows the user to look at two different parts of the same file system.  Users can also change the location of "dockable frames and/or toolbars" to create a customizable workspace.  This creates a very simple
intuitive file transfer client tailored to each user of Serv-U.
::END

$DESC_PANE_LOCAL_REMOTE$::
The local and remote panes allow the user to quickly navigate through a file system.  Each pane has a similar layout which eases
the user into a comfortable transition between the two file systems.  The panes also inherit the functionality of the
"$LINK_DOCKING_FRAMEWORK$", which allows the user to customize the layout of each pane.  Each local panel shows the contents of
the client's local file system and each remote panel shows the contents of the server's remote file system.
::END

$HEAD_LOCAL_PANE$=Local Pane

Why does the browser fail to communicate with Serv-U when I logout of FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_BROWSER_FAIL_ON_LOGOUT$::
FTP Voyager JV and the browser it was launched from share the same session ID that Serv-U uses to communicate to the
corresponding client. Therefore, after logging out of FTP Voyager JV, the browser it was launched from no longer has a valid
connection to Serv-U.  It is necessary to login again through the browser to establish a new connection to Serv-U.
::END

$QUESTION_CAN_NOT_LOGOUT$::
Why can't I logout of Serv-U?
::END
$ANSWER_CAN_NOT_LOGOUT$::
FTP Voyager JV can logout of Serv-U.  There's an option in the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog under the $LINK_PREF_PAGE_GENERAL$
tab that allows automatic logout from Serv-U when FTP Voyager JV closes.
::END

$QUESTION_JRT_NETWORK_SETTINGS$::
If I have multiple browsers on my machine, can I use both to launch FTP Voyager JV?
::END
$ANSWER_JRT_NETWORK_SETTINGS$::
Yes.  Both browsers can be used to simultaneously launch FTP Voyager JV.  However, use caution: because the Java Runtime only uses
the proxy settings of the "default" browser, FTP Voyager JV may use the wrong proxy settings.  For instance, if your default browser
is Internet Explorer, which is setup to use a proxy server, then FTP Voyager JV also uses these proxy settings even if it was launched
by Mozilla Firefox.
