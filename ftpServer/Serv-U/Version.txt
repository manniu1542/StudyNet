=======================
+ Added the ability to press the tab key to iterate over each dockable frame of FTP Voyager JV.
+ Added an administrative warning in the Management Console when upgrading from Serv-U 32-bit to Serv-U 64-bit when a server or domain database could not be opened possibly due the need to create a matching 64-bit "System DSN" or "User DSN".
- Corrected a bug, introduced in version 10.0.0.2, where Windows Authentication would fail with SSH2.
- Corrected a database bug where failure to write a user account was not being identified.  This is especially critical when upgrading from Serv-U 32-bit to Serv-U 64-bit and using a database.  When upgrading from 32-bit to 64-bit customers are required to create another "System DSN" or "User DSN" using the corresponding 64-bit drivers.
- Corrected a database creation bug, introduced in 10.0.0.5, where NVARCHAR use for Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel is not allowed.  When database tables were created the database failed to create the tables.

- Corrected a problem with Microsoft SQL Server where UNICODE strings were not being written correctly.  This change is only for Microsoft SQL Server.
- Corrected an internal 64-bit bug where Microsoft changed header files for two ODBC functions to use SQLULEN (32-bit in Windows 32-bit, 64-bit in Windows 64-bit) instead of SQLUINTEGER (32-bit).  This problem only affected Serv-U 64-bit installations.
- Corrected a bug where disabling a domain would show all users and groups in that domain as being disabled.
- Corrected an event bug where the "User Disabled" event wasn't being fired when an administrator disabled a user from the activity window.

- Corrected a bug in the Management Console where part of the OS logo on the "Program Information" tab would be hidden when using an Opera browser.
- Corrected a bug in the Management Console where using the "Enter" key to save form information in certain dialogs would refresh the page and not save the changes when using either Safari or Google Chrome browsers.


10.0.0.2 (May 17, 2010)
=======================
Engine:
+ Added support for Windows 64-bit (AMD64/x64).  Serv-U 64-bit is installed automatically when installing on a Windows 64-bit computer.
+ Added IPv6 support.  This feature includes separate listeners for IPv6 addresses, IPv6 CIDR support, IPv6 access rules, and logging.  Serv-U supports IPv6 without losing any functionality supported with IPv4.
+ Added a new groups tab for Windows Organizational Units (OU).  This new feature gives administrators finer control over Windows authenticated sessions.
+ Added "Group Administrator" and "Read-Only Group Administrator" support.  Group Administrators can administer users, administer groups, and monitor sessions within the same group(s).
+ Added support for the EPRT (Extended Port) and EPSV (Extended Passive) FTP commands.  These commands support both IPv4 and IPv6.
+ Added the ability to specify non-absolute message files for the FTP CWD, XCWD, CDUP, and XCUP commands so that message files (such as ".message") may be presented as part of a command response.
+ Added event rules to configure events so they fire only under specified conditions.
+ Added a Directory Listing limit to the server, domain, group, and user where an absolute or non-absolute message file may be specified.  When users change to the specified directory the message is displayed in a dialog (within the Web Client and FTP Voyager JV) and returned via part of the FTP response.  This feature in not supported by SFTP.
+ Added the ability to hide from clients whether or not a file or directory is compressed or encrypted.  These new limits are available per user, group, domain, or the entire server.
+ Added the ability to force users to change their password at their next login.
+ Added an HTTP limit adding the ability to disable HTTP media play capabilities in the Web Client.
+ Added an HTTP limit to disable the "Remember Me" check box on the HTTP login page.
+ Added an HTTP limit to disable the "Language" drop list on the HTTP login page.
+ Added an HTTP limit to disable the "Theme" drop list on the HTTP login page and in the Web Client.
+ Added an HTTP limit to specify the default language on the login page when clients connect with browsers localized with a language in which Serv-U isn't localized.  Serv-U uses the browser's language settings to select the default language when known.
+ Added the ability to limit HTTP media playing during certain times of day.
+ Added additional administrative log information to help identify detailed information about administrative activities.
+ Added server logging information about WinSock initialization including the version number in-use and initialization failure.
+ Added server logging information about the version of Windows.
+ Added triggered event logging.  Information is placed in the log whenever an event is triggered.  This is useful when implementing events.
+ Added new system variables: $LoginID (session login ID like $Name but refers to administrator login ID, not the target user in administrative operations), $OSAndPlatform (outputs the operating system name and platform)
+ Added new path variable %USER_FULL_NAME% to complement %USER%.  %USER_FULL_NAME% replaces the variable with the user accounts "Full Name" field.
+ Improved UPnP device discovery so that more Internet gateways can be located and configured.
+ Added IP address information to PASV port range server log messages to help identify the IP addresses available and being used for PASV port ranges.
+ Added the "Serv-U User's Manual", available in the start menu.
+ Improved failed file transfer logging and events by checking the status of the connection at close time.
+ Improved SFTP (via SSH2) upload performance for clients using very fast connections but sending very small SSH packets.
+ Added SSH command logging for SSH_MSG_IGNORE, SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED, and SSH_MSG_DEBUG including the number of bytes received for each command.
+ Added logging options to enable and disable SFTP and SSH2 detailed logging.  Affected commands are: SSH_FXP_READDIR, SSH_FXP_READ, SSH_FXP_WRITE, SSH_MSG_IGNORE, SSH_MSG_DEBUG, SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED
+ Added file transfer failure logging and events for SFTP (via SSH2) transfers.  Due to the nature of SFTP, certain assumptions are made to determine whether a file is being uploaded or downloaded.  An SFTP transfer failure is assumed when a file is not explicitly closed by the SFTP client.
+ When adding a group, the Group Name is now trimmed, removing leading and trailing white space.
+ Updated OpenSSL libraries from 0.9.8m to 0.9.8n.
- Corrected a bug when downloading a file and a file system read error caused the termination of the download, Serv-U was not returning an error to the client.
- Improved login response code error when unable to go to a user's home directory due to a "device not ready" error.
- Corrected an event bug where certain server string variables were not available to events.  ($Date, $Time, $ServerVersionShort, $ServerVersionLong, $ServerDays, $ServerHours, $ServerMins, $ServerSecs, $ServerKBup, $ServerKBdown, $ServerFilesUp, $ServerFilesDown, $ServerName, $ComputerName, $OSVer, $OS, $ServerFilesTot, $LoggedInAll, $ServerUploadAvgKBps, $ServerDownloadAvgKBps, $ServerAvg, $ServerUploadKBps, $ServerDownloadKBps, $ServerKBps, $UNow, $UAll, $U24H, $ServerSessions24HPlusOne, $ServerSessions24H, $UAnonAll, $UNonAnonAll)
- Corrected an event bug where certain domain string variables were not available to events.  ($DomainKBup, $DomainKBdown, $DomainFilesUp, $DomainFilesDown, $DomainFilesTot, $DomainLoggedIn, $DomainUploadAvgKBps, $DomainDownloadAvgKBps, $DomainAvg, $DomainUploadKBps, $DomainDownloadKBps, $DomainKBps, $DomainSessions24HPlusOne, $DomainSessions24H, $UAnonThisDomain, $UNonAnonThisDomain, $DomainName, $DomainDescription)
- Corrected a bug where FTP message files and the user's welcome message would interpret the "\" and the following character as special characters and cause messages to appear garbled when using FTP.
- Corrected an FTP data channel bug, introduced in Serv-U 9.4.0.0, where Serv-U did not recognize a PASV/EPSV command had already been issued prior to uploading a file when uploading very small files (or empty files) on a very fast connection.  This problem only occurred with a certain FTP client.
- Corrected an installer bug where upgrading from Serv-U <= 6.4 when an administrator password was applied, login to the Management Console would always fail.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) bug where Serv-U would check directory size too frequently and when not necessary during file uploads.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) upload bug where random access writes to files was incorrectly appending to the file.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) login problem where logins using no user ID and no password would not be counted against Serv-U's anti-hammer option.
- Corrected an SSL shutdown bug where, under rare circumstances, Serv-U would miss socket shutdowns during uploads causing the client to appear to hang upon completion of an upload.  This applies to FTPS and HTTPS only, SFTP (via SSH2) is unaffected.

- Corrected a bug in the help files where extended character codes for single quotes were not being rendered correctly.
- Corrected a bug where bubble tip messages where not independently closable when multiple bubble tips where displayed simultaneously.
- Corrected a bug when Domain Administrators entered an unavailable system variable, the error message caused the Management Console to freeze until refreshed.
- Corrected a bug where the "Lock in Home Directory" check box in the User Wizard dialog was overriding inherited values and did not allow for the inherited value to be used for the user being created.
- Corrected a bug where the FTP Command Properties dialog for the "XCWD" and "XCUP" commands did not allow configuration of message files.
- Corrected a bug where text selection was not working for logs.

Web Client:
+ Added color coded text to depict compressed and encrypted files and folders in the Web Client and Browse dialogs.
+ Added a directory properties dialog to the Web Client showing modified time, created time, last accessed time, space available, and directory size.
+ Added the ability to enter text to be displayed on the HTTP login page.  The text may be customized for individual domains or for the entire server.

+ Added the ability to move files and directories using drag and drop.
+ Added mouse over feedback for rows when using Windows Vista Theme or greater.
- Corrected a visual bug on the FTP Voyager JV launch page that occurred when the mouse is over the "Download Java Now" and "Restart FTP Voyager JV" buttons.  This only happened in Internet Explorer on machines that didn't have Java installed.
- Corrected a visual bug on the FTP Voyager JV launch page where the "Logout" button was not positioned correctly on the page.  This only happened in Internet Explorer on machines that didn't have Java installed.

FTP Voyager JV:
+ Added color coded text to depict compressed and encrypted remote files and folders in the file lists and trees.
+ Added shaded text and icons to represent hidden local and remote files and folders.
+ Added shaded folder icons to represent folders for which a directory listing has not been performed.
+ Added a "Remove Completed" button to the transfer toolbar.
+ Added a button to the File / Folder Properties dialog that allows users to request a single remote directory's size and space available.
+ Added a dialog that displays the remote listing message file.
+ Changed the overwrite dialog to resemble Microsoft Windows 7's overwrite confirmation dialog.
+ Added support for saving the window coordinates over multiple monitors.
- Corrected a bug in the remote file listing where drive icons were not being shown correctly for the "Large Icons" and "Thumbnails" view.
- Corrected a bug in the "Confirm Logout" dialog where the cancel button did not have enough room to render correctly on Linux operating systems.
- Corrected a bug, when saving the window coordinates and maximized, the maximized coordinates were being saved in addition to the maximized state causing FTP Voyager JV to remain full-screen even when unmaximized after restarting.


9.4.0.2 (April 1, 2010)
=======================
+ Added functionality for keyboard arrow keys to toggle focus between buttons for FTP Voyager JV confirmation dialogs.
+ Changed data socket shutdown to be more forgiving of FTPS clients that do not perform SSL shutdown correctly.  Affected clients would appear to "lock up" when performing directory listings or downloading files via FTPS (FTP over SSL).  The solution is to add a 5-second timeout after SSL shutdown has begun.
+ Added right-click context menus to the Events list in the Management Console.
- Corrected a bug where Serv-U would truncate very large directory listings when bandwidth limits were in place.  In some cases downloaded files could be truncated too.
- Corrected a bug in the Management Console where the disable and delete dates displayed in the User list were incorrect on some non-English operating systems.
- Corrected a bug when overwriting a zero-byte file, Serv-U was incorrectly requiring append privileges.
- Corrected a bug where the "User Disabled" and "User Enabled" events might not fire when changing the account type.
- Corrected a bug where admin events were being fired for an administrator's domain not the user's domain.
- Corrected upgrade notices from Serv-U versions <= 6.4 where Serv-U 8 and Serv-U 8.0 was referenced.

9.4.0.0 (March 23, 2010)
========================
+ Added Portuguese (Brazil) Web Client support.
+ Updated Spanish strings.
+ Added Spanish Management Console help translation.
+ Added the ability to disable user accounts at the group level as well as at the user level.
+ Added new static font properties to the Management Console and Web Client for better visual appearance.

+ Changed Domain Administrators so that they can view information about themselves.
+ Improved hover events for dialogs in the Management Console and Web Client to decrease CPU usage.
+ Changed the log file lines when listening on "<< Any IP Address >>" so that the "0.0.0.0" IP address is shown and all IP addresses are shown in parentheses.
+ Added IPv6 addresses to the Serv-U Tray's About dialog Network Information page.
+ Changed the STOU (store unique) FTP command to accept and return full paths instead of using the current directory only.  When a full path is not specified the current working directory is used.  This is to remain consistent with Serv-U versions <= 6.4.
+ Changed the STOU (store unique) FTP command 150 response to include the full path name of the new file.  This is to remain consistent with Serv-U versions <= 6.4.
+ Changed FTP PORT connections back to the client to be more forgiving.  RFC 959 (section 3.2, paragraph 1; section 5.2, paragraph 2) requires the socket to bind to the command channel port -1 (L-1).  However, in Windows, this may cause the socket error WSAEADDRINUSE (10048).  When this specific error occurs on the data channel, Serv-U attempts to connect without binding to the command channel port -1 (L-1).
+ Added an FTP LIST/NLST command option to list a specific file's full path name as part of the listing when a specific file's listing information is requested.
+ Added a directory listing setting for server-side sorted listings using natural language comparison like Windows Explorer (i.e., FTP and SSH listings).  This setting is available at the server, domain, user, and group levels.  The default is enabled.
+ Added an error message when attempting to use the tray application's menu option to change the Windows service setting fails.
+ Signed Serv-U.exe and Serv-U-Tray.exe so that Windows recognizes Rhino Software, Inc. as the publisher.
+ Updated Microsoft DLLs to the latest release.

+ Added a timestamp to the signing of FTP Voyager JV's JAR files allowing the Java Runtime to validate FTP Voyager JV's JAR files after their certificate's expiration date.
+ Changed the FTP Voyager JV "Save Login" dialog controls so they cannot be changed to reflect a different configuration other than the current login information.
+ Changed the layout of the FTP Voyager JV "Save Login" and "Preferences" dialogs to a standard layout.
+ Updated the FTP Voyager JV JIDE user interface library to version 2.7.7.
+ Changed the User Collection Combo box to locale sort its contents upon loading of the user pages in the Management Console.

- Corrected an SSL shutdown bug where an open SSL socket was being closed while the server and client were performing an SSL shutdown exchange (SSL_shutdown()).  This problem appeared when listing very large directories with certain FTP clients using GnuTLS.
- Corrected a bug where toggling FIPS 140-2 mode would not work.  Restarting Serv-U would change to the desired FIPS mode.
- Corrected a licensing bug where sessions that were not logged in were being counted against the license.
- Corrected an FTP bug where Serv-U was not returning an error response to LIST, MLSD, RETR, THMB, STOU, or STOR when a data channel had not been specified with either the PORT or PASV command.
- Corrected an FTP LIST/NLST switch processing bug when specifying a directory format (-h:DOS, -h:IIS, -h:UNIX) any following path names would be ignored.
- Corrected a logging bug where system administrators were being identified as domain administrators.
- Corrected a database problem when using PostgreSQL and adding columns to tables.  PostgreSQL's syntax for adding multiple columns to a table is different than other SQL servers requiring the "ADD COMMAND" text before each new column name.
- Corrected a bug where the "FileTransferStats_BytesUploaded", "FileTransferStats_BytesDownloaded", "FileTransferStats_FilesUploaded", and "FileTransferStats_FilesDownloaded" columns were not being written to the database with the other runtime statistics for database users.  File transfer statistics were being cleared when viewing database user statistics after the last session for a user logged out.  This bug was introduced in 9.2.0.1.
- Corrected a bug when deleting a database group, user membership in that group was not being deleted.
- Corrected several minor database user and group bugs.

- Corrected an FTP Voyager JV bug where the "Save Login" dialog "Is Secure" check box was not checked when connected securely.
- Corrected an FTP Voyager JV bug where a file or folder name would not revert back to the original file name if a rename operation failed.
- Corrected an FTP Voyager JV bug where the status bar was not showing the correct file path for certain local directories (e.g., Desktop, Computer).

+ Improved user group lookup when a very large number of groups is used.
- Corrected a bug in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 where IE would make requests of JavaScript instead of files(appears to be a buffer problem in IE).  The symptom would present itself in the Management Console as a "Permission Denied" page.  This is a work-around for Microsoft Internet Explorer's (version 8) bug.
- Corrected a tray bug when using Microsoft Internet Explorer as the default browser.  Changing from using Windows' Default Browser to the tray's embedded browser would cause the Management Console to show the "Loading" dialog until being restarted.
- Corrected a security issue where it was possible to see directories above a user's root directory (Secunia SA37847).
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) bug where certain clients requesting both read and write access to a non-existent file, would not be able to upload or create that file unless the file already existed.
- Corrected several Simplified Chinese translation errors.
- Corrected a Simplified and Traditional Chinese translation error where the "SSH public key" was translated as "SSH private key".

+ Added support for interpreting <LF> (line feed) characters as end-of-line markers when transferring files in ASCII mode.  When enabled <LF> end-of-line markers are converted to <CR><LF> sequences.  This transfer limit applies to both FTP uploads and downloads.
+ Added an option to the Serv-U Tray to start Serv-U as a service or manually.
+ Changed database user storage to store only required user attributes at login, logout, and user password change.  These changes allow database administrators to manage their database much more independently.
+ Added support for PostgreSQL databases.
+ Changed transfer speed limits so they are applied to active sessions even when the session previously had no limit.  Previous versions did this only if active sessions had a limit already in-place (i.e., a speed limit was changed, not added).
+ Added additional security checks to ensure Serv-U application integrity.
+ Added the ability to search drop lists using keyboard presses in the Management Console.
+ Added the ability to close dialogs using the Escape key in the Management Console and Web Client.
+ Added support for CIDR notation for IP ranges in addition to Serv-U's wildcard method.
+ Added the ability to permanently block an IP address using the anti-hammer rule for the domain or server.  When triggered an IP address is added to the top of the IP access rules permanently.  When added, the server's configuration files are updated so the IP address remains blocked even between Serv-U restarts.
+ Added the "FTP password type" password limit to the Server, Domain, and Group levels in addition to the user level.  A global or group setting may be applied to use MD4/MD5 OTP passwords for FTP.
+ Added "MaxDomainSessions", "MaxDomainSessionsIP", "MaxDomainUploadRate", and "MaxDomainDownloadRate" to the server limits & settings in addition to the domain limits and settings.
+ Added the ability to export the users in all collections and database from the user's tab and externally with the Serv-U-Setup.exe program.
+ Added a drop down list of available IP addresses in the Listener dialog and in the Domain Creation Wizard.
+ Added the ability to specify %HOME%, %USER%, or %DOMAIN_HOME% as part of the SSH public key path.
+ Added additional Domain Administrator restrictions so a domain administrator cannot change the following limits: "MaxDomainSessions", "MaxDomainUploadRate, "MaxDomainDownloadRate"
+ Changed configuration, account configuration, startup log, and data files location to "C:\ProgramData" (ALLUSERSPROFILE environment variable) in Windows Vista and above on new Serv-U installations that are installed in "C:\Program Files" only.  This is required on Windows 7+ when UAC is in effect.
+ Removed some unused HTTP files.
+ Removed some Server and Domain session management code that was duplicated elsewhere.  This change will save a small amount of RAM for servers with many concurrent connections.
- Corrected "Cookie Buffer Overflow Vulnerability" (Secunia SA37228).
- Corrected a bug where Serv-U could crash after disabling an active user.
- Corrected a bug where user accounts whose login ID ended with a period character were not being shown in the users grid.
- Corrected a bug where downloading 0-byte files using FTPS could cause the data channel to be disconnected during SSL negotiation causing 0-byte downloads to intermittently fail.
- Corrected a bug where the Advanced Directory Access rule password was being saved incorrectly when using a database.  When using MS SQL the bug would appear as a lost directory access rule.  When using other databases, the password would just be invalid; if using these advanced settings and storing to a database, modification of the user record would cause improper access to the directory access rule.  This problem only occurred on MS SQL 2005+ because MS SQL throws an error instead of truncating the value.
- Corrected a bug when saving encrypted strings to database or .Archive file, Serv-U would archive values even when the encrypted string was empty.
- Corrected a bug in the Web Client where the "Playlist" button would not work when in "Search" mode.
- Corrected a bug where user lookups would occur after a session's login ID was cleared.  This resulted in unnecessary user and database user lookups.
- Corrected a bug where database users' statistics were not being loaded correctly after loading data from the database.
- Corrected a bug when FTP Voyager JV, the .jar files were being downloaded every time FTP Voyager JV was started.  Now, when unchanged, Java uses its cached copy of the FTP Voyager JV .jar files.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV, where the Last-Modified timestamp of a file that was uploaded from a non-English operating system would fail.
- Corrected a bug in the Web Client where focus was being lost when using the keyboard to navigate the file list.
- Corrected a bug when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 and lower when using a database domain, installation / conversion would cause the installer to crash.
- Corrected a bug when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 and lower when using a database domain, group membership for users would not be imported under certain rare circumstances.
- Corrected a bug when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 and lower when using a database domain, import would not work correctly if the old table names matched the new default table names in Serv-U 7+.
- Corrected a database bug when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 or lower, and using the table names "User" or "Group" would cause the upgrade to fail.
- Corrected a database bug where daily session counts were not being written to the database.
- Corrected a bug where Tray messages boxes (confirmation, error, warning) would be displayed without text in all languages.
- Corrected an SFTP logging bug where the SSH_FXP_REALPATH was not being logged, just the reply.
- Corrected an SSH2 problem where Serv-U was not responding to the SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST command.
- Corrected a user group membership problem when changing group membership for a user that is connected, certain variables applying to limits, were not being properly adjusted.  For example limiting access by IP address.
- Corrected a bug where passwords that were stored in an unencrypted form (i.e., clear-text) were not checked letter case sensitive.
- Corrected a bug where users created with the User Wizard were being stored without encryption.
- Corrected a Windows 7 UAC problem where Serv-U was unable to communicate with the tray application to identify Serv-U status and enable tray / engine communication.
- Corrected a problem, introduced in Serv-U 7.0, where the STOU FTP command would append a digit to a specified file name even when the specified file name doesn't exist, an inconsistency with Serv-U versions <= 6.4.

- Corrected a problem where Serv-U could not create private key pair files with passwords when FIPS 140-2 mode was enabled.
- Corrected a memory / handle leak when using Windows Authentication, Serv-U was not releasing memory when attempting to retrieve a Windows User's home directory.
- Corrected a bug where FTP Voyager JV would not launch from a Macintosh computer running Snow Leopard with the Safari web browser.


9.0.0.1 (September 29, 2009)
============================
Serv-U Engine:
+ Added FULL UNICODE support.  Serv-U is now capable of supporting file paths, user names, and passwords in any language supported by Windows.
+ Added the ability to install any supported language on any localized version of Windows.  For example, installing Japanese, Chinese, or Russian Serv-U is now supported on Windows in English.

+ Added new login statistics for the Server, Domain, Group, and User, all individually viewable.  These new statistics include: number of logins, number of logouts, current logins, most concurrent logins, last login time, last logout time, average login time, longest login duration, and shortest login duration.
+ Added options to save Users and Groups statistics to CSV file.
+ Added support for SFTP (via SSH2) welcome messages.  If a welcome message or welcome message file is specified, Serv-U sends the message with the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_BANNER message.
+ Added the ability to limit when a user or group can log in based on the day-of-the-week and/or the time-of-day.
+ When an IP address is in an approved IP address list that approved IP address is no longer blocked when automatically blocking IP addresses unless the IP address is approved because of *.*.*.* or * in the IP access list.

+ Added two new user events identifying whether or not password recovery was successful.
+ Added a new domain event identifying when a log file is purged.
+ Added the ability to add comments to individual IP Access rules.
+ Added the ability to wait for up to 30 seconds for an executable event to complete before continuing execution in Serv-U.  This is useful if an executable needs to move or copy a file before Serv-U deletes it (such as purging a log file).
+ Added the ability to download the current log file from within the Management Console.
+ Changed log file format to UTF-8.
+ Added the ability to purge log files based on the total size or total number of log files in a directory.  This feature deletes the oldest log files when either limit is exceeded.

+ Added a new Connection limit to Users, Groups, Domains, and the Server which can require users to have a reverse DNS name to connect or login to the server.
+ Added the Advanced Limit to disable renaming files and directories to paths that already exist; applies to users, groups, domains, and the entire server.  FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP (via SSH2) versions 3 & 4 are the affected protocols.  SFTP versions 5 and above uses a different mechanism as defined by the protocol, unless the client uses the SSH_FXP_RENAME_NATIVE flag.
+ Added the ability to disable specific database tables.  Disabling unused tables can reduce the number of ODBC calls.
+ Changed the default User and Group table names from "User" to "SUUsers" and "Group" to "SUGroups" in order to avoid "reserved" Microsoft SQL keywords.  Microsoft reference page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189822(SQL.90).aspx
+ Added new FTP system variables: $CurrentUncompressedTransferBytes and $CurrentCompressedTransferBytes
+ Reduced the database column sizes for non string columns by default.  This is due to some restrictions by some databases on the total row length.
+ Added "Windows 7" to the $OS system variable.
+ Changed Serv-U's automatic listener recovery (periodically attempts to listen again when unable to listen) so that this feature is disabled when more than 50 domains are defined.  This is done to save CPU cycles on slower computers.
+ Automatically create log file directory structure if the parent directory of a specified log file doesn't already exist.
+ Changed the "OPTS UTF8 ON/OFF" command to be available prior to login.
- Corrected a bug where the "SITE SET TRANSFERPROGRESS ON" FTP command could cause Serv-U to crash.

- Corrected a bug where database column mapping would not work.
- Corrected an attribute availability bug when specifying the start time "after" the end time, Serv-U would not properly handle this condition.
- Corrected a security bug where Serv-U was showing all drives and virtual paths to drives for "\" when a user may not have had permission to list all drives or virtual paths to drives.
- Corrected a directory listing / change directory bug where Serv-U was not allowing access to a parent directory, in some cases, if permissions for the parent directory were not explicitly set.
- Corrected a bug in the MFF FTP command where Serv-U was not ignoring the space between the "fact" and the "path name", causing MFF to fail with an incorrect path response.
- Corrected a bug where the UNIX directory mask would not work correctly if "r" (read) and "w" characters were not being used in the same locations as the default.  This was changed to remain consistant with Serv-U version <= 6.4.

Management Console:
+ Added a domain navigation tree for one-click access to any configuration page, including any server configuration page.
+ Changed the group membership dialog in the Management Console to hide the "Add" and "Remove" arrows when nothing is selected in the corresponding list.
+ A randomly generated password is automatically created when creating new users.  The password is fully highlighted so if not desired simply typing a new password over the existing requires no extra work for an administrator.
+ Changed the Domain wizard to prompt either for one-way or two-way password storage.
+ Added the ability to set the advanced properties for database user and group limits.
+ Changed all lists, inside the Management Console, to use "natural sorting" to properly sort items according to the current locale.

- Corrected a bug where "Transfer Ratios" were not being saved correctly causing the wrong information to appear in the dialog.
- Corrected a bug where the UNIX directory mask could not be saved.

Web Client:
+ Added a powerful file search feature to the Web Client that allows users to recursively search for specified files using exact file name matches or wildcard matches.
+ Added a Windows Vista & Windows 7 style "bread crumb" navigation bar for easier directory navigation.
+ Added a history navigation menu for faster navigation to previously viewed directories.
+ Added the ability to auto play video files in the Web Client by setting a URL parameter (playmedia=1).
+ Changed file and folder list, to use "natural sorting" to properly sort files and folders according to the current locale.
+ Changed the default theme for Windows 7 to use "Windows Vista".
+ Added an alert dialog on the login page to inform users to upgrade to IE8 to improve performance.
- Corrected a Web Client upload bug, where uploading a small file, locally or on a very fast connection, the Web Client could think the file did not upload, even when it did.  This problem occurred mostly in Firefox browsers.
- Corrected a Web Client upload bug, where uploading a file that would overwrite a file with the same name, and had encoded characters, would fail to prompt the user for accepting the overwrite.
- Corrected a bug where when logging in using an Opera browser on Japanese Windows would fail to read cookies needed to set the language and cause the page to reload continuously.
- Corrected a bug where the wrong string was used for the alt tag in the Web Client header image.

Tray:
+ Added a tray option to use the system browser instead of the embedded Internet Explorer.  Using the system browser can be faster, depending on the browser, and can reduce the amount of RAM used by the tray application.
+ Improved accuracy of "XX KB", "XX MB", and "XX GB" displays to round up to the next highest value instead of checking for any amount over the unit (as older versions of Windows did).  (Tray Application and FTP Voyager JV)
+ Added support for saving the tray's Management Console Window coordinates over multiple monitors.
- Corrected a bug in some dialog boxes that caused the font to shrink and adjusted the sizing on some images.  This bug was only noticeable on Japanese Windows.

- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where the active frame would move from the local frame to the remote frame after a "New Folder" operation was completed.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV, introduced in version 8.2.0.1, where uploading files with non-ASCII characters would fail in many cases.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV that failed to change the password for users that had non-ASCII characters in their "User Name" and/or "Password" fields.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV that failed to overwrite and move a remote file between two remote directories that had the same file name.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where the overwrite dialog would show the resume button even if copying or moving files across the same file system.


8.2.0.3 (August 17, 2009)
=========================
+ Upgraded to Inno Setup UNICODE installer to provide greater localization flexibility in the future.

- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where uploading a file with non-ASCII characters in the file name, Serv-U would receive an incorrect file name.
- Corrected a problem where Serv-U was unable to operate on UTF-8 encoded file names for FTP, FTPS, and SFTP (via SSH2) when the "Convert URL characters in commands to ASCII" limit was set to "yes".  This limit is a very old FTP option, that should probably always be disabled or "no".  This limit now only applies to FTP sessions.


8.2.0.0 (August 3, 2009)
========================
+ Substantially reduced the RAM requirements for servers with many domains and very high traffic servers.  Serv-U requires about half of the RAM or less as with previous versions through 7.0.
+ Updated the look and feel for the "Windows | Office 2003" styles for FTP Voyager JV.
+ Added additional checks to prevent high frequency login attempts on a single session (i.e., dictionary login attacks).
+ Serv-U 8.1.0.1 through 8.1.0.3 cached Windows login tokens, user IDS, and passwords; previous versions did not.  For potential security reasons, token logging has been removed for login.
+ Improved the load time of the FTP Voyager JV startup page by loading only images that apply to the browser.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV, introduced in version 8.1.0.1, where the active frame failed to receive focus when the user clicked within the empty space of a grid.
- Corrected a bug where FTP Voyager JV would fail to launch if certain JavaFX resources could not be loaded.

- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where sorting special Window directories interfered with the sort results of certain folders and files.
- Corrected a bug where "Port Forwarding" could prevent FTP Voyager JV from getting a listing from Serv-U.  This would only happen if the router's public port was different from Serv-U's private port that was listening for HTTP connections.
- Corrected a problem when starting Serv-U as a service, the service initialization could fail (timeout) when a very large number of domains were defined.
- Corrected a bug where French and Italian result strings were being interpreted incorrectly by the browser.  In the case of the Web Client, an error message would appear for French and Italian once a file began uploading.
- Fixed a bug in the User's Group Membership dialog where scrolling would not work correctly when the number of groups in the list exceeded the viewable area of the list.
- Corrected an SSL/TLS bug where Serv-U would not recognize a closed socket after calling SSL_read() from OpenSSL.


8.1.0.3 (July 21, 2009)
=======================
+ Updated Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Russian strings.
+ Added a new Password Limit to use either one-way (more secure, less functional) or two-way (less secure, more functional) password encryption when storing passwords to disk.
- Corrected the FTP FEAT response to comply with RFC 2389 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2389) so that the listed features are always preceded by a single space, and never the response code.  This deviation from the RFC was introduced in Serv-U 7.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV, introduced in version 8.1.0.1, where FTP Voyager JV was not saving the file list column order between sessions.
- Corrected a bug where a Swedish string warning about the trial expiring could cause the Tray application to crash.  Only Swedish installations were affected.
- Corrected a Web Client problem with the Safari and Opera browsers, when downloading files with spaces in the file name, Safari and Opera would incorrectly use %20 for spaces as part of the file name instead of the actual file name.
- Corrected a bug where it was impossible to change if passwords are encrypted on disk or not.  Introduced in 8.1.0.1.


8.1.0.1 (July 8, 2009)
======================
+ Added read-only administrator support.  Two new administrator user types have been added, "Read-Only System Administrator" and "Read-Only Domain Administrator".
+ Substantially increased internal HTTP parsing to improve the speed of the Management Console and Web Client.
+ Changed localization (translations) internally to use individual string files instead of separate resource DLLs.
+ Converted all ReadMe_??.txt files translations to UTF-8.
+ Eliminated License.txt from the installation, License.rtf is the exclusive licensing file instead.
+ Added support for UNICODE / UTF-8 passwords.  This allows passwords to be extended beyond the ASCII characters.  NOTE: some FTP clients do not use UTF-8 for S/Key encoding and therefore may fail.
+ Changed the RhinoSoft.com company logo in the "Program Information" tab to the new 3D version.
+ Changed certificate creation to use UTF-8 allowing certificates to contain any character.
+ Changed certificate viewing to decode UTF-8 encoded certificates.
+ Added the ability for the browse dialog in the Management Console to use the specified directory path as the starting point.
+ Added the ability to export users to CSV (comma separated value) files to complement Serv-U-Setup.exe's ability to import.  See the Serv-U Knowledge Base for full details.
+ Increased the width of the path fields so that space is more effectively used as a result of the size reduction of the "Browse" button in 8.0.0.7.
+ Improved the availability for user system variables for events that do not have an associated login (e.g., User Delete and User Create).
+ Improved browser error message handling retrieving result codes server-side instead of client side.  Saves bandwidth and memory allowing only needed messages to be transferred to the browser.
+ Improved numeric field verification in the management console to provide more specific information about invalid entries.
+ Improved file and directory path field verification in the management console to disallow invalid characters.
+ Changed the group membership to a side-by-side list to make adding and removing membership much more efficient.
+ Added support for the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to identify the actual IP addresses of client computers.  This is primarily set by proxy servers and load balancers.
+ Added cipher information to the active session monitor grid and "Spy & Chat" dialog.
+ Changed SSH login so that the "none" login request, used by most SFTP clients to determine the supported authentication modes, doesn't cause an event to fire and extra entries added to logs.
+ Hide the "Create Directory" button in the Web Client if the logged-in user does not have any directory creation permissions.
+ Added a cancel button for FTP Voyager JV's logout dialog.  This allows the user to go back into FTP Voyager JV.
+ When launching FTP Voyager JV for the first time, the column widths expand evenly to fill the available space.
+ Optimized FTP Voyager JV downloads to use less server-side RAM when a user is logged in.
+ Changed the format for FTP Voyager JV error codes for easier debugging.
+ Added extra support information to FTP Voyager JV's launch page that responds to the Apple Java Update 1.6_13 for Macintosh machines.  This update can break the automatic startup of the "Java Web Start" application which opens "jnlp" files.
- Corrected a bug where multi-byte path names would not be interpreted correctly in some cases.
- Corrected an HTTP bug where a user could bypass the password requirement gaining normal access as granted by the user account.
- Corrected an HTTP bug where HTTP sessions would not immediately end when Windows Authentication was enabled.  The HTTP sessions would eventually timeout, however failed logins should have caused the sessions to close immediately.
- Corrected an HTTP bug when downloading a file that is actually a Virtual Path where the file name is different than the Virtual Path's file name, Serv-U would provide the actual file name to the browser when downloading instead of the Virtual Path file name.
- Corrected a bug where using IP Access rules to block access for a user (by setting the user's IP access rules) could cause Serv-U to crash.
- Corrected a help bug when viewing Japanese Management Console Help the table of contents frame was in English.
- Corrected a Macintosh Firefox problem where the "Browse" button in the upload dialog would be partially truncated.
- Corrected an FTP PASV command problem when using PASV port ranges, on some systems Serv-U could rarely run out of PASV listeners.
- Corrected a problem when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 or lower, certain configurations would not upgrade to Serv-U 8.0.
- Corrected mistakes in ReadMe.txt and License.rtf.
- Corrected a bug where email event messages were not being identified as UTF-8 even though they were encoded as UTF-8.
- Corrected a bug where certain user events (User Deleted, User Enabled, User Disabled, User Password Changed, User Password Change Failure) would not fire for the user's domain or would fire for the session's domain.  Now these events are fired for the domain in which the user is defined.
- Corrected a bug in the "Do not log IP rule" dialog in the Management Console where the buttons were misaligned.
- Corrected a bug in the Management Console where dialogs could not be moved when the page was scrolled down.
- Corrected a bug where viewing a certificate could cause Serv-U crash the next time OpenSSL was used due to the inadvertent closing of the OpenSSL libraries.

- Corrected a bug in the Management Console where the Login ID was not being URI encoded when editing the user causing editing to fail when non-ASCII characters were used.
- Corrected a bug when an email event was setup for Server Shutdown, Serv-U would not send the message.  Now Serv-U waits for up-to 30 seconds to shutdown if pending email events exist.
- Corrected a event bug where execution of an external program could fail if a user was logged in as a Windows User that didn't have the proper permissions to execute that file.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) bug when the client uses SSH_FXP_OPEN to open a file, and didn't request any access permissions, Serv-U would create a 0-byte file.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) bug when the client uses SSH_FXP_OPEN to open a file, requesting both read and write permissions, Serv-U could create a 0-byte file.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) bug where Serv-U would always truncate a file when the SSH_FXF_CREAT and SSH_FXF_WRITE flags were specified to open a file.  Serv-U now truncates the file only when the SSH_FXF_TRUNC flag is specified.
- Corrected a database bug; when the search value for the primary table was changed to something other than "LoginID" (for users) or "GroupName" (for user groups), updates to database records could not be performed.
- Corrected a bug where FTPS transfers could drop the last few packets of data depending on how the client uploads files.
- Corrected a Web Client bug when uploading a file, the file name was not being encoded in UTF-8 causing Serv-U to store UTF-8 encoded file names incorrectly.
- Corrected a Web Client bug where the "Home" button would not appear in the "/" directory when the user's home directory was elsewhere in the path, and the user wasn't locked in the home directory.

- Corrected a directory access bug when a user is locked in the home directory, and the home directory is a drive root, the user could access directories to which permission was not granted.
- Corrected a Virtual Paths bug where Serv-U versions 6.4 and lower checked visibility of both the virtual path and the physical path, Serv-U 7.0 - 8.0 were not.
- Corrected a rename bug where the destination file or directory name could contain invalid characters and Serv-U would incorrectly report a successful rename operation.
- Corrected a bug where an invalid Windows Shortcut could cause Serv-U to fail, leaving the connection in an invalid state where the session would appear to hang.  Other connections were not affected.
- Corrected a tray pop-up menu bug where, on systems running for a very long period of time, the "Themes" menu would appear only as a bar, instead of the submenu.
- Corrected an installation bug when upgrading from Serv-U 6.4 and lower and using s/key passwords.  The conversion would incorrectly set this value for converted user accounts.  Introduced in version 8.0.0.7 only.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where a rename of a local file that had its file extension hidden would cause the file to lose its extension.

8.0.0.7 (April 6, 2009)
=======================
+ Updated OpenSSL libraries from 0.9.8j to 0.9.8k.
+ Moved "Password Type" to the Password Limits & Settings to unclutter the main user tab.
+ Changed the "Password Type" value to read "FTP Password Type" since it applies only to FTP connections.

- Corrected a bug where a session's home directory may be incorrectly interpreted when the user is locked in the home directory.
- Corrected a bug where Serv-U could assume that a remote directory name such as "/temp" was the same as "D:\temp" where the drive letter is the drive upon which Serv-U is installed.  This only occurred when the user had full access to the machine and the user account listed drives.
- Corrected a layout issue where the HTTP login page would improperly position the login button for Finish in Firefox under Windows Vista.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where multiple directory listings would occur when navigating to a parent folder while in Thumbnails mode.
- Corrected an SFTP (via SSH2) but where Serv-U would not fully resolve Windows shortcuts as specified.  Certain SFTP attributes referenced the .LNK file instead of the target, this included the file type, file attributes, and the date and times of the target.


8.0.0.4 (March 26, 2009)
========================
+ Added the connected server name to the FTP Voyager JV title bar.
- Corrected a bug, introduced in 8.0.0.1, where UTF-8 encoding and decoding was not working correctly in all cases.

8.0.0.1 (March 23, 2009)
========================
Serv-U Engine:
+ Added programmable server, domain, user, and group events to send email messages, display balloon tips, or execute third-party software (Serv-U Gold only).
+ Added support for SFTP versions 5 & 6 (via SSH2), in addition to SFTP versions 3 and 4.

+ Added sub-second support for SFTP (versions 5 & 6).
+ Added the ability to set file types via SFTP (version 5 & 6), read-only, system, hidden, and archive.
+ Added the ability through SFTP versions 5 & 6 to get and set file times to sub-second resolution.
+ Added the ability to specify the maximum SFTP version to use for users, groups, domains, or the server.
+ Added support for substantially faster and more efficient SFTP file transfers for clients supporting SFTP versions 5 & 6.  Clients may perform reads and writes to files of sizes greater than previous SFTP versions (34,000 bytes).
+ Added support for "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1" for SSH key exchange.
+ Added support for "hmac-sha1-96" for SSH MACs.
+ Added the ability to change user passwords through SSH2.

+ Automatically redirect from HTTP to HTTPS when a secure connection is required and a corresponding HTTPS listener is found.
+ Added a connection limit to ban an IP address for a period of time after a session has timed out.  This limit is available for users, groups, domains, and the entire server.
+ Added user and group connection limits to enable or disable individual protocols; FTP/FTPS, HTTP/HTTPS, and SFTP (via SSH2).
+ Added millisecond resolution to FTP file times for FTP/FTPS MLST/MLSD results.
+ Added millisecond resolution when setting file times via FTP (MDTM, MFMT, MFCT, and MFF).
+ Added an option to the FTP MKD/XMKD commands to enable creation of parent directories if they do not exist.
+ Added the ability to set a maximum file size for uploads for users, groups, domains, or the server.

+ Created a new default self-signed SSL certificate using SHA-1 instead of MD5 for added security.
+ Changed the installer to install the default SSL certificates even when they already exist in an installation.
+ Changed the logging path for HTTP_LIST to show the file name as well as the directory when listing a specific file.
- Corrected a DOS vulnerability where FTP could become saturated for a long period of time before allowing new connections.  This vulnerability would not cause a crash, but would lock the server for a long period of time.
- Corrected a directory traversal vulnerability where it was possible to create a directory outside of a locked user's home directory.  All protocols were affected.
- Corrected a logging bug where HTTP logouts for a single session would appear twice in the log.  Introduced in version 7.4.0.0.
- Corrected an FTP login bug where passwords starting with a '-' character would not allow logins.  This was due to the compatibility with certain older UNIX systems where specifying a '-' character as the first character for a password, would disable multi-line FTP responses (see release below notes for Serv-U 2.4).
- Corrected an FTP MLST bug where listing a virtual path would return the physical path's file or directory name instead of the virtual path name.
- Corrected an HTTP upload and download statistic bug where more bytes than the actual number transferred were being tallied; in most cases almost twice as much.
- Corrected an automatic home directory creation bug, when logging in as a Windows User, where the logged in user doesn't have read and write permission to the parent directory of the user's home directory; Serv-U was unable to create user's home directory automatically.
- Corrected an SFTP bug where relative paths were not working.  The SFTP specification identifies "file names" not starting with the "/" character to be paths relative to the user's home directory.
- Corrected an SFTP bug when attempting to set the file attribute; failure would cause Serv-U to close any open file and invalidate the client's file handle causing uploads or downloads to fail.
- Corrected a cosmetic bug where Serv-U would not correctly set the letter case for Windows Shortcuts when Shortcuts are treated as links instead of files (the default setting).
- Corrected a bug where paths containing wildcard characters "*" and/or "?" could return the first matching file or directory and allow non-wildcard operations to be performed (such as delete, upload, and download).
- Corrected a bug where performing a wildcard listing in a directory, and a subdirectory matched the wildcard, the subdirectory's content was listed instead of the parent directory using wildcard matching.
- Corrected a bug where wildcard listings on "\" (the computer's available drives for the logged in user's account) would not work correctly.
- Corrected a bug when listing with wildcards in directories with virtual paths.  When no physical file existed matching the wildcard but a virtual path did Serv-U would not list the virtual path.
- Corrected a bug when specifying a domain home directory, if the directory path contained a trailing "\" character, Serv-U would not correctly limit the directory size.

Tray:
- Corrected a problem where pressing the Escape key in the About dialog while viewing release notes for a new version did not always dismiss the About dialog.

Management Console:
+ Substantially improved the Management Console speed in which Users and Groups pages are loaded, especially on single-core machines.
+ Decreased size of all Management Console pages by 15%-50%.

7.4.0.0 (January 5, 2009)
=========================
+ Added the SFTP client name to the log when identifying the client's requested version number.
+ Allow SFTP SSH_FXP_REALPATH commands to work on "." even when the directory rights don't allow listing the directory.  This function returns the full path of the current directory as used by some SFTP clients.
+ Allow SFTP SSH_FXP_REALPATH commands to work on "" (an empty path) as many SFTP servers do.  When an empty path is specified, the user's home directory is assumed.
+ Removed the obsolete FTP command "SITE INDEX".  This functionality is available through the LIST command and the recurse ("R") parameter.  For example "LIST -lR *.txt" lists all text files recursively.
+ Changed the FTP QUIT, HELP, FEAT, AUTH, PBSZ, PROT, HOST, and REIN commands so they can be executed even while the session is required to change the password.
+ Upgraded development environment from Microsoft Developer Studio 2005 to Microsoft Developer Studio 2008.

- Corrected a Basic Web Client problem where the cursor was not placed in the edit field for rename.
- Corrected a Basic Web Client bug when using Safari where Safari would download and save files using the server name or IP address instead of the actual file name.
- Corrected a problem where XCRC would not abort when operating on large files.
- Corrected a problem where performing XCRC, STOU, DSIZ, AVBL, RNTO (moving a large file to another volume), RMDA (remove directory and contents) operations could cause Serv-U to stop accepting connections and commands when these commands were lengthy.
- Corrected an FTP PORT bug when using multiple IP addresses on the same subnet, Serv-U might not bind over the correct IP address (interface).
- Corrected an FTP LIST bug where listing recursively using wildcards would not recurse directories.
- Corrected an FTP LIST bug where listing recursively when a mask was specified, the mask was shown as part of the subdirectory label.
- Corrected an FTP HELP bug where nested commands such as "HELP SITE CHMOD" would show only the command information for "HELP SITE".
- Corrected an FTP HELP bug where "HELP OPTS UTF8" would show only the help information for "HELP OPTS MODE".
- Corrected an FTP USER bug when a password was expired, but the original password was blank, "500 INTERNAL ERROR" response was returned instead of "233 User logged in, PASSWORD EXPIRED - please change before proceeding.".
- Corrected an FTP SITE PSWD bug where if either specified password was blank, the command would be interpreted incorrectly.
- Corrected an FTP THMB bug where specifying an invalid thumbnail type could cause an invalid result code.
- Corrected an FTP STOR bug with certain clients where uploading many small files over a LAN could cause Serv-U to neglect telling the client a file was uploaded.
- Corrected an FTP CCC bug when using a fast connection, Serv-U could switch out of SSL mode after the next command comes in causing Serv-U to misinterpret the next command.
- Corrected a thumbnail creation bug while logged in as a Windows User where the logged in user doesn't have read and write permission to the Windows Temporary directory, Serv-U was unable to create thumbnail images.
- Corrected an SFTP bug where setting the file attributes for a read-only file was not possible.
- Corrected an SFTP bug where setting the file size using the SFTP attributes would fail, Serv-U was not returning an error.
- Corrected an SFTP bug when creating a directory, the attributes parameter was being ignored.

- Corrected an SSH bug where the login ID and passwords were not being UTF-8 decrypted.
- Corrected an SSH bug where client-server key re-exchange would succeed, but Serv-U was unable to decrypt subsequent SSH packets due to Serv-U failing to use the previous SSH Session ID.  SSH key re-exchange usually occurs after each gigabyte of data transfer or each hour of connection time.
- Corrected an SSH bug where disabling all ciphers or MACs could cause Serv-U to crash or leak memory when a client connects.
- Corrected an internal HTTP file request bug while logged in as a Windows User where the logged in user doesn't have read permission in the installation's HTTP directories, Serv-U was unable to download and use certain files, such as larger image files.
- Corrected an HTTP download bug, introduced in version 7.3.0.2, where compression was being used when downloading already compressed files.
- Corrected an HTTP download bug when compression was being used and the result of run-time compression was larger than the original file, a partial file could be downloaded due to the client's use of the "Content-Length" HTTP parameter.
- Corrected an HTTP logging bug where smaller downloaded files may not be logged after successfully downloaded.  This race condition appeared more frequently on multi-core computers.
- Corrected an HTTPS download bug where IE 7+ could truncate the downloaded file under certain circumstances.  The solution involves removing the HTTP parameter "Content-Length" for IE 7+.  When not included IE is not able to show the download progress for the file.
- Corrected a user database bug when enabling or disabling a user account outside of the Serv-U Management Console would not allow logins from the user account until Serv-U was restarted.

- Corrected a logging bug where the proper letter case for paths was not being used in the log.
- Corrected a problem when using many IP addresses (255 or more) on a single computer, Serv-U would use too much CPU time every 15 seconds causing certain operations to be delayed.
- Corrected a problem when using many listeners (255 or more), Serv-U would use too much CPU time every 5 seconds.


7.3.0.2 (October 10, 2008)
==========================

7.3.0.1 (October 8, 2008)
=========================
+ Added the ability to view and download 3 different sized images on the iPhone/iPod Touch (small, medium, and full-sized).
+ Changed iPhone/iPod Touch keyboard so that it doesn't start automatically with CAPS on for all input fields.
+ Improved "Unable to establish SSL connection" log message when the client simply disconnects during the negotiation phase.  This usually indicates that the client has rejected the SSL certificate.
+ Improved the Basic Web Client for the iPhone and iPod Touch by disabling the parent directory buttons when in the user's root directory.
- Corrected an iPhone/iPod Touch bug where the "Up Directory" button would not work in the home directory if the user wasn't locked in the home directory.
- Corrected a problem where large HTTP/HTTPS uploads could pause indefinitely.  This problem could appear when Serv-U was running on a multi-processor / multiple-core server.
- Corrected a Basic Web Client bug where keyboard focus was not reset to the file list after a delete confirmation dialog was displayed.
- Corrected an FTP display bug when specifying a wildcard character such as "*" or "?" as a parameter for a path name, Serv-U would return the first file with the matching name in its response.
- Corrected an SFTP bug where closing a file handle, and attempting to set the file attributes on a file where permission is denied could cause Serv-U to crash.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where uploading a directory with the same name as the destination would produce an error.
- Corrected a security bug where specifying a Windows port (such as CON:, LPT1:, PRN:, etc.) when using the STOU command, could cause Serv-U to consume all of the CPU time on a processor.  This problem could only occur when write privileges were granted to the specified directory.  (Secunia SA32150)
- Corrected a security bug with rename where moving a file or directory to a location where delete privileges were not granted for an existing file or directory, would cause the file or directory to be moved.  (Secunia SA32150)
- Corrected a security bug with rename where placing the destination in "\" (i.e., "My Computer") would cause the file to moved to the current Windows directory.


7.3.0.0 (October 1, 2008)
=========================
+ Added Basic Web Client support for the iPhone and iPod Touch.
+ Added a new path macro, %DOMAIN_HOME% to allow home directories, Virtual Paths, and directory access rules to use the specified home directory for the domain.
+ Added the ability to use the "Enter" key to save settings in the limits dialog.
+ Added a log message that identifies when a file has been downloaded as a thumbnail instead of just identifying the file as having been downloaded.
+ Added a log message that identifies the start of an upload or download in SFTP.  FTP and HTTP both included this log message, but SFTP did not.
+ Added the ability to enable or disable automatically starting of the tray application from the tray's pop-up menu.
+ Added support for the MFMT (Modify Fact: Modification Time), MFCT (Modify Fact: Creation Time), and MFF (Modify Fact: Facts) FTP commands (according to draft-somers-ftp-mfxx-04).
+ Added Management Console support for Google Chrome.
+ Added additional trouble shooting information for the FTP Voyager JV start page when running Safari.
+ Changed the installer to recognize whether or not the tray application is started automatically upon login to Windows.  The installer now maintains this setting between installations.
+ Improved reverse DNS handling for servers implementing very large numbers of banned IP addresses, Serv-U now places priority on session reverse DNS requests.
+ Improved background timer handling in the case where a server is so busy the process is CPU starved; in such situations internal timer execution is forced to ensure execution of background processes.
+ Improved several Russian strings.
+ Improved support for certain FTP clients that send extra invalid characters as part of their "ABOR" FTP command.
+ Removed the Serv-U Version number from all HTTP pages except for the Management Console.
+ Removed the HTTP restriction ensuring session requests were coming from the same IP address.  This is necessary for clients, such as the iPhone, whose IP address changes very frequently.

- Corrected an MDTM bug where specifying the time zone offset to set the date and time of a file would fail.
- Corrected a bug while using compression via FTP, Serv-U could stop accepting uploaded data if conditions were right.
- Corrected a bug where changing to a directory that should be hidden was allowed.  User permissions for reading and writing were working correctly, however clients could change to the directory, which could allow the client to identify the existence of a directory.
- Corrected a group database bug where changing the group name would cause a new group to be created in the database with the changed group name.
- Corrected a group database bug where changing the group name would not update users using the group.
- Corrected a cosmetic bug where updating a group name by only changing the letter case Serv-U would not update the group name for users in the group.

+ Improved the FTP Voyager JV upload error handling.  When errors occur during an upload, the Basic Web Client now displays an error message on certain failures such as insufficient disk space and over quota messages.
+ Added the ability to switch domains (using Virtual Hosts) during login for FTP clients that do not user or support the HOST command.  The format for the USER command is "USER SP FQDN | username CRLF" where FQDN is the Serv-U virtual host (i.e., "USER host|userid").
+ Added the ability to switch domains (using Virtual Hosts) during login for SSH clients.  The user ID can be specified as the virtual host name, followed by "|" then the login ID.
+ After a successful HOST FTP command, Serv-U also returns the sign on message for that domain.
+ Changed the use of the PASV port range to circulate through each of the ports instead of using the first available port.  This was done so that some NAT routers work better with Serv-U and to be more consistent with previous versions of Serv-U.
- Corrected a bug on some systems when running as a service when access to removable drives was enabled only for the console user, not the service account (via HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon, values allocatefloppies, allocatedasd, and allocatecdroms set to 1), Serv-U would prompt for a password when trying to configure Serv-U via the tray application.

- Corrected a quota bug where the current quota bytes could go negative.
- Corrected a quota bug where overwriting existing files from the first position in the file (i.e., not resuming), would not restore credit to the quota.
- Corrected a quota bug where bytes uploaded were being recorded even when a quota was not in place.
- Corrected a bug where transparent PNG images on the login page were not rendering correctly when using IE 6.
- Corrected a Management Console bug where the rows in certain tables would not be displayed.
- Corrected a bug where changing the listener to a different type, but keeping it on the same port, would cause Serv-U to think it wasn't listening correctly, showing warning icons in the listener list and on the tray.  This was a rare user configuration bug, and only occurs due to user action.
- Corrected a bug where Serv-U would attempt to recreate listening sockets when it didn't need to.  This didn't affect Serv-U's performance, but this timed operation did use unnecessary CPU cycles.
- Corrected a problem where the floppy drive could be accessed when starting the tray's Management Console.
- Corrected a problem in the Management Console where images in the alert dialog would be broken if the connection with Serv-U was lost.
- Corrected a bug when using a Domain or Server level FTP message file containing a blank line, Serv-U could crash (GPF).
- Corrected a bug where setting a directory access rule maximum size for %HOME% or a directory containing %USER% would be ignored.
- Corrected a bug where setting a directory access rule for a directory without the Inherit permission, would cause listings using specific file names or wildcard file names to fail with a "Permission Denied" error.
- Corrected a wildcard permission problem where specifying wildcard access prior to other access, the wildcard access may not work as it did in previous versions.
- Corrected a permissions bug when resuming an upload.  Serv-U was requiring delete permissions when append permissions were required for the resume.  Delete permissions are only required when resuming anywhere other than at the end of the file.

- Corrected a bug where certain path fields could not be cleared, such as the Log File Path field for a domain.
- Corrected a database bug where numeric login IDs were being incorrectly selected from the database, due to missing quotation marks in the SQL search string.  Databases were considering login ID "1" to be the same as "01".
- Corrected a database bug where custom column mappings were not working.


7.1.0.2 (June 2, 2008)

For example, disabling all permissions of "*.exe" using directory access rules, Serv-U would still allow uploading of any .EXE file if the proper parent permissions were set.
- Corrected a problem where directories using the "[" character would not list correctly due to *NIX wildcard comparison support.  Support for character set filtering has been removed from Serv-U.
- Corrected a bug where moving users to a different user collection would lock up the Management Console (not Serv-U itself) and the move would fail.
- Corrected a bug where using the enter key to move to the next section in the User Wizard dialog would fail to put focus in the next input field.
- Corrected a bug where changing a user's password type would lock up the Management Console and the dialog could not be closed.

+ Added support for CSID (Client / Server Identification Exchange) to identify the client to the server, and the response identifies the server to the client.  The information exchanged includes the name and version number of the client and server, and information about the server including the operating system, file system letter case sensitivity, operating system version number, and directory separator.  This command obsoletes the CLNT command.
+ Added the "SITE HELP" and "SITE HELP cmnd" command to support clients, such as Internet Explorer, that make this request.
+ Added a new configuration option for NLST, where NLST can be configured to list empty directories instead of returning "550 No file found.", which is more meaningful to FTP clients than returning an error code.
+ Added new tags for FTP and HTTP (welcome message) string replacement.  The new tags are $ServerName, $OS, and $OSVer.
+ Added new tags to the System Variables section of the Help documentation under Additional Reference.  The new tags are $ServerName, $OS, and $OSVer.

- Corrected a bug where the AVBL and DSIZ commands would return an invalid value when attempting to list the non-existent "\" directory (i.e., all drives).
- Corrected a bug where an FTP active data socket that was supposed to bind on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) Serv-U wouldn't bind to that IP address only.
- Corrected a bug when attempting to rename a drive, Serv-U would not return with an error code.
- Corrected a bug where issuing PASV then ALLO instead of immediately trying to transfer a file, the ALLO command (or any non-transfer threaded command) could fail due to a misinterpretation of an internal result code.
- Corrected a bug in the XCRC FTP command where sending "XCRC file.fid", then "XCRC file.fid 0 100" would generate the same result even though the second command checks only part of the file, not the entire file.
- Corrected a bug in the log where the log would show a blank user name when a user not requiring a password would login.
- Corrected an HTTP / HTTPS login bug with Windows Authentication, where the login could appear to hang with the "Loading" dialog.

- Corrected a problem where the bubble tip dimensions in the management console were not calculated correctly when long title names were used.
- Corrected a bug where the update notification dialog / balloon tip would appear every 2 hours if an update was available.  This notification now only appears every 3 days, as was originally intended.
- Corrected an FTP data socket bug where Serv-U was not recognizing a data socket was closed, and would not allow another data socket on that IP address and port.  This problem showed when attempting to do server-to-server (FXP) transfers.
- Corrected a potential GPF (crash) bug when shutting down Serv-U after clients have connected, using FTP, and changed hosts via the HOST command, to the non-primary domain on the IP address.
- Corrected an SFTP (SSH) bug with the SSH_FXP_FSTAT command where Serv-U would always return SSH_FX_NO_SUCH_FILE.

- Corrected a bug where Serv-U could crash (GPF) when automatically blocking an IP address for a domain based on invalid login attempts.
- Corrected an ODBC problem with MS SQL 2005 where the database returns failure when data doesn't exist.  Serv-U was attempting to reconnect to the database assuming it had timed out, but it hadn't.  Now Serv-U uses a built-in 5 minute timeout before attempting to reconnect to the database upon errors.
- Corrected an ODBC problem with MS SQL 2005 where the database would return an error regarding "Connection is busy with results for another hstmt".
- Corrected a Basic Web Client bug where the Slide Show could show a placeholder image for the first image if no file is currently selected or the currently selected file is not an image.

- Corrected a bug where the "NLST command also lists directories" check box under the NLST Advanced Options tab was not visible in Internet Explorer and did not function properly in Firefox.
- Corrected an installation problem when the tray's about dialog was up, and installing, the tray application would not close.
- Corrected a problem when entering registration IDs with carriage return, line feed, space, and/or tab characters in the ID.  When entered into the dialog, Serv-U strips these characters.

7.0.0.2 (April 9, 2008)
=======================
+ Updated Traditional and Simplified Chinese license files.
+ Updated Japanese Management Console strings.
+ Reduced the size of several translated license files.
+ Updated Swedish translation and added as an installation option.
+ Changed the VARCHAR definitions from 512 to 255 for database creation so Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access can be used as a database for Serv-U.
- Corrected a bug where Serv-U would allow certain operations in the computer root ("\") instead of on a UNC path or drive path.  The computer root is not a physical entity that can be written to or read from.  Because of this operations must be denied.
- Corrected a bug where the copyright text on the Server Details page under the Program Information tab was being wrapped incorrectly.
- Corrected an ODBC bug where the SQL statement used to add columns to an existing table did not work for MS SQL 2000.
- Corrected an ODBC bug where if the columns of data were requested "out of order" (according to the column ordinal) MS SQL 2000 would fail.
- Corrected a problem with old Serv-U Corporate registration IDs.
- Changed how anonymous FTP login works when anonymous login is not allowed.  As with previous versions of Serv-U, when "USER anonymous" is received, it is accepted, until the "PASS xxxx" command is received, when the anonymous login is rejected.  This change is due to Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer, rejecting the user after the USER command causes the login to fail, and not prompt for a user ID and password.
- Corrected a bug where Windows shortcuts to drives would cause a GPF (crash) if Serv-U is treating Windows shortcuts as the target.
- Changed the default ASCII / BINARY transfer mode (which is only cosmetic in Serv-U) to ASCII as with versions prior to 7.0.0.1.
- Corrected a problem where the TYPE FTP command was not supporting the "REPRESENTATION TYPE (TYPE)" format as outlined in RFC 765.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where SSL uploads would insert an HTTP protocol header into the uploaded file.  This also improves the transfer speed.
- Corrected a bug in FTP Voyager JV where the Help button of the About dialog was broken.


7.0.0.1 (April 2, 2008)
=======================
+ Added support for the HTTP protocol with a built-in web client.
+ Added support for the SFTP (via SSH2) protocol.
+ Added support for FTP Voyager JV via the HTTP protocol.
+ Added the THMB command to convert graphical files to thumbnails then download.  The THMB command acts exactly like RETR, except prior to transfer the file is reduced to the specified format and maximum size.
+ Added the HOST command which allows the FTP client to change to a specific domain on the server.  This allows the FTP server to support multiple domains on a single IP address and port.  NOTE: not all FTP clients support this feature.  FTP Voyager, for example, does.
+ Added the DSIZ command to return the size of a directory's contents, including sub-directories.  A directory may be specified, or if left blank, the current working directory is used.
+ Added the AVBL command to return the number of bytes available in a directory.  A directory may be specified, or if left blank, the current working directory is used.
+ Added support to enable and disable specific FTP commands.
+ Added support to change nearly any FTP command responses.
+ Added dynamic HELP information where HELP sends all supported and enabled commands.
+ Added command level HELP.  For example "HELP LIST" returns help specifically about the LIST command
+ Added the use of a floating buffer size when reading from files being downloaded by a client.  The floating buffer size is based on the transfer rate for the ongoing transfer, making transfers much more efficient.
+ Added directory rename rights setting.
+ Added file rename rights setting.
+ Added the "\" path concept.  The "\" path is similar to "My Computer" in Windows Explorer.  When a user's home directory is set to "\" a listing of "/" shows the available disk drives.  Users who are not logged in their home directory can also take advantage of this feature when the "Allow root ("/") to list drives for unlocked users" is set to true at the user, group, domain or server levels.
+ Changed FEAT to list special commands only when they're enabled.
+ Changed the "OPTS MLST" command to be more forgiving of clients that don't follow the RFC exactly.  For example, Serv-U now accepts both "OPTS MLST Type;Size;Modify;Perm;" and "OPTS MLST Type;Size;Modify;Perm"
+ Added the "Perm" feature for MLST and MLSD commands, "Perm" identifies permissions for an item in an MLST/MLSD listing, relative to the connected user.
+ Added the "Win32.dt" feature for MLST and MLSD commands, "Win32.dt" identifies a drive type for disk drive listings, when listing /C:/, /D:/, or /.  This feature will not be returned in a directory listing if the item is not a disk drive.
+ Added the "Win32.dl" feature for MLST and MLSD commands, "Win32.dl" identifies a drive label for disk drive listings, when listing /C:/, /D:/, or /.  This feature will not be returned in a directory listing if the item is not a disk drive.
+ Added more information to the MLST / MSLD Type fact for "os.UNIX=slink" where Serv-U now also appends ":linked_path" if this information is available to the user.
+ Improved Windows Shortcut resolution to also include shortcuts using relative paths and other combinations of attributes.
+ Added the ability to specify path names with spaces when using the "SITE EXEC" command.  If spaces are required, Serv-U parses the file name in quotes.
+ Added the XDEL command, same as DELE.
+ Added RMDA directory as a superset of RMD, allowing the client to delete a directory an all of its files and sub-directories in one command.  An error response indicates that the client should refresh its directory listing to determine which files and sub-directories were deleted and which where not.
+ Changed Windows Link support so that when Windows .LNK files are encountered they are treated as the file they reference when listing, for the SIZE command, and transfer operations.
+ Removed the -L LIST and NLST option because it can conflict with other settings.
+ Perform all lengthy commands in a worker thread, freeing up the main thread to service other clients.  These operations include LIST, NLST, MLST, MLSD, RMDA, RETR, THMB, RNTO, XCRC, STOR, APPE, STOU, SITE EXEC, and all other lengthy operations.
+ Added the use of multiple CPUs to perform CPU intensive activity.
+ Added transfer totals and transfer rates to the "226 Transfer complete." reply.
+ Added compression totals, statistics, and transfer rates to the compressed "226 Transfer complete." reply.
+ Added the ability to define anti-hammer limits for the domain in addition to at the server.
+ Increased the maximum string length in a message file from 195 characters to 512 characters.
+ Added an option to include server response values to the FTP command processor to include the numeric response code in every line of a multi-line response.
+ Added an option to include server response values for individual message files.
+ Moved message file settings with the appropriate FTP command and to individual command processors.
+ Added the ability to set maximum file sizes for files of certain types, based on the file extension.  This feature is implemented through directory access rules where wild cards can be used to identify file access rights.
+ Added maximum directory size restrictions for directories specified in the directory access rules, replacing disk quotas.
+ Added upload and download bandwidth limits for the entire server, each domain, each group, and each user, in addition to session bandwidth limits.
+ Added additional statistics to the STAT command.
+ Improved the ALLO command to check the amount of disk space available to the user, instead of just the hard drive space available.  This change takes into consideration quotas and directory size limits.
+ Added the ability to show directory listings in Microsoft IIS FTP Server (-h:IIS) format or DOS (-h:DOS) (command line from Windows 2000 or greater) format with the FTP LIST command.
+ Added -h:"DOS", -h:"IIS", and -h:"UNIX" (default) LIST directives.  -h:"DOS" lists files and directories similar to the Windows command line.  -h:"IIS" lists files and directories similar to Microsoft's IIS FTP server.  -h:"UNIX" lists files and directories similar to BSD UNIX FTP servers.  Any other -h"xxx" directive reverts back to "UNIX" style listings.  This directive is not letter case sensitive.
+ Changed the operation of IP access rules.  If there are no "allow access" rules, "*.*.*.*" is automatically assumed
+ Added the ability to see blocked IP addresses in the IP access rules list when disconnecting a user from the active session list.
+ When uploading and overwriting a file, the original file is renamed to the specified file name.
+ Changed directory listings not to show "." and ".." when the user is locked in the home directory.
+ In directory listings that show "." and ".." normally, these are properly shown whether or not they exist in Windows.  This helps to aid both in navigation and in preventing the user from being able to determine if a directory is a root virtual path or not.
+ Added the ability to see passwords in the logs on failure, and with FTP commands.
+ Added categorization for users to help organize users into logical groupings.  When users are placed into separate categories the Management Console can perform more efficiently as can Serv-U.
+ Access to virtual paths can now be granted by allowing access to the physical path only.  Previous versions required an explicit access setting to the virtual path as well.
- Corrected an error when exceeding the maximum number of login attempts after being logged in at least once, where Serv-U would return two error replies instead of one.
- Corrected an error where certain LIST and NLST parameters did not work correctly, for example -I:"*.txt" to ignore certain files.
- Corrected an error in MLST/MLSD where Serv-U could return file times 1 hour incorrectly when the server is currently running in Daylight Saving Time and the file date and time is not and vice versa.
- Corrected a bug where "Sub-directory Inherit" was ignored when a full path is specified containing a wildcard string.  For example C:\Windows\*.jpg would not include C:\Windows\System32\*.jpg even when the inherit flag was selected.
- Corrected a bug where recursively listing directories where Virtual Paths referenced the parent directory, would cause Serv-U to crash.
- Corrected a bug when using "blind" directories, where directory access to directories nested at least two deep have access, it was possible for sessions to never be able to go back to the home directory with the CWD command.

Tray
+ Added new style menus.
+ Added the ability use different themes.
+ Added Theme Editor.
+ Added balloon tips.

+ Partially uploaded files can be automatically deleted via a 'setup - server' menu option.
+ In case a client closes the command connection while there are ongoing transfers this is now properly logged and passed to the event notification mechanism.
+ Files are now kept open during transfers. This means files being uploaded show zero length during the upload.
+ The reply message after a dir listing or file transfer now shows the client his/her ratio and quota status (if the client is using ratios and/or quota).
+ Added SITE command to the event hooking mechanism. Any SITE command can now be intercepted by an event notification DLL.
+ The CWD ('change working directory') command no longer actually changes the Serv-U task's current directory which caused locking of the dir in NT.

+ Users with no password (ie. 'Password' entry in the .ini file explicitly set to nothing) are logged in immediately after the USER command.
+ Users can be given an empty password (ie. no password required when logging in) by entering "<<None>>" in the password field of the user setup.
+ To create or delete directories the user now needs the appropriate access to the parent of the dirs that are being created/deleted.
+ Users with setting "allow login when max. no. of users is reached" now also have no time-out after logging in.
+ Server now switches to 'crippled' try-out when try-out time is up.
+ When the version is out-of-date the server now allows 'crippled' use.

+ Minor changes to socket stack handing with the hopes that it will work with (even) more WinSock stacks.
+ The SIZE command now works with either 'list' or 'read' access to the file.  This used to require 'list' access.
+ Data transfers now use a socket bound to the same IP as their command connection. This should fix a rare problem with multi-homed sites and firewalls.
- Fixed bug in total file transfers count as shown in the status bar.
- Changed code so the maximum path length for the 16-bit version is 80 characters. This is conform the Win16 maximum path length. Longer paths caused crashes in Win16 functions.
- Fixed bug in system tray menu (Win95) when Serv-U gets started automatically after system startup.
- In case Serv-U is started for the first time, but with a KEY.TXT file present it will no longer ask for the try-out option but read in the key.
- Transfer speed reports use 1024 bytes per Kb rather than (previously) 1000.
- Fixed bug which would show a tray icon in NT4 even when the server was started 'hidden'.
- Fixed bug in SIZE command causing it to deny access if directory didn't have 'inherit' access.


2.2 (February 22, 1997)
=======================
+ In case 'current' disk quota is set larger than 'maximum' uploads are no longer allowed.
+ Changed the data connection message for uploads/downloads to be more UNIX compatible (some browsers use this to get the file size from).

+ Changed IP access rule mechanism. It is now more flexible. Added .ini file conversion for new rule format.
+ Added option to specify IP access rules for each user individually.
+ Added tray icon support for Win95 and NT4.
+ Changed code so 32-bit version can handle more IP homes (now it'll do around 1800 IP numbers, while the 16-bit version handles about 180 IP numbers).
+ LIST now completely ignores any '-' type options. NLST only parses '-l' and converts that to a LIST command. This should make the latest CuteFTP work.
+ Added support for running Serv-U as a system service in Win95.
- The security manager no longer checks for the presense of the SERV-U.INI file which hopefully solves a very rare problem where the server cannot read the .ini file after several days (in NT3.51 SP5).

+ The evaluation order of IP deny and allow rules can now be choosen.
+ Changed link handling so if there is a subdir with the same name as a link preferance will be given to the subdir.
+ Changed '%dfree' message file directive so it handles >2Gb of free space.
+ All links should now be absolute paths, even for users with 'rel. paths' enabled. Serv-U takes care of the conversion for dir listings etc.
+ Added support for the FTP command STAT, showing UL/DL ratios and quota.
+ Changed %bup, %bdown, %btot, and %dfree to report in Kb instead of bytes.
+ Added support for secundary 'dir change message file' and 'link file'.

+ Added support for external client verification DLLs. 
+ Bulletproofed the input buffer. It now handles any length strings.
- Fixed problem with user setup changes that would not show up immidiately.
- Fixed bug in MDTM command.
- Fixed problem in NT preventing directory deletion.
- Fixed bug causing GPF's while making server setup changes that resulted in a server restart.
- The '&' character in the registration key (if present) is now displayed correctly.


2.0b (May 4, 1996)
==================
+ Bullet-proofed the 'relative paths anonymous' option. Now impossible to get out of the homedir (and subdirs below), even if user has access rights for other paths.
+ Changed '~' handling.  Now works when embedded inside a path.
- Fixed bug in 'Resume' command (FTP command 'REST').
- Changed code for painting text & images in 'About' box, hopefully solving problems on Win3.1 and WFW3.11.


2.0a (April 18, 1996)
=====================
+ Remote program execution (Through SITE EXEC) now launches the program from the current directory of the user.
+ The Serv-U directory is now searched first for SERV-U.INI, then it looks for an evironment variable named SERV-U, and finally the PATH and Window's directories are searched for the .ini file (Order changed over previous).\
+ Added option to make server exit pending upon the logged in users.
+ Added the FTP command REST (=RESTart).
+ Changing the file name for directory change messages no longer causes the server to log out all users.
+ Added the FTP command MDTM (=Modification Date & TiMe).
+ Hidden directories are now hidden from anonymous users (as are hidden files) in the 32-bit version.
+ Transfer speed in 'User Info' box is now averaged.
+ Links embedded in a path will now be resolved correctly. This will make things work better with Netscape which keeps links as part of the path.
+ 'Maximize' system menu item is now disabled in the user info box.
+ Added file size to transfer logs.
- Fixed problem with window size/position when user info box got closed while minimized.
- Fixed problem with links containing trailing '\'.
- Fixed bug in '%dfree' text directive in 16-bit Serv-U.
- Fixed bug in DNS lookups that caused GPF's.
- Background colors of bitmaps (in 'About' etc.) now display correctly on non-gray windows.
- Fixed error reply for 'SITE EXEC' in case no executable was specified.
- Fixed bug that caused 'File - Exit' to skip the confirm dialogbox.
- Fixed bug in '~' handling. It can now be used in links.
- In case CTL3DV2.DLL is missing the 16-bit version will no longer throw an exception.


2.0 (March 13, 1996)
====================
+ This version will continue to work after March 15th (All previous versions stop at that date).
+ Converted code to BC 4.52 and OWL 2.5. 
+ Now 16- and 32-bit versions.
+ Added separate access right for 'list' access.
+ Added a luxurious 'user info' box.
+ Added IP Name logging.
+ Added a 'enable account' checkbox to quickly enable/disable a user.
+ Access rules can now be specific to a single directory, or inhereted by subdirs (the previous method).
+ Changed the FTP 'HELP' command reply to be more UNIX compatible.
+ Added a ton of new '%' directives for signon/signoff messages, directory change messages, and login messages.
+ Changed icons.
+ 'hidden' files are no longer indicated as such in dir listings (confused the Mac client 'Fetch').
+ The permission server now uses UDP messages instead of TCP.
+ Added support for user specific login messages.
+ Changed font and size of signon/off message dialog box.
+ Added support for 'links' (like UNIX).
+ User is now booted off the server if the password is guessed wrong 3 times.
+ Time a user was connected gets logged.
+ Inserting new paths in the access rule list is now done at current position instead of to the end of the list.
+ 'CWD ' (='cd') or 'CWD ~' will now put the user back in the home directory.
+ 'NLST *' (='ls') or 'LIST *' (='dir') will now convert to '*.*', ie. will use UNIX style globbing.
+ Now even softer on your socket stack...
+ Made the 'undocumented features' part of the setup.
+ Changed directory listing format to be more UNIX compatible.
+ Cleaned up local heap management, so the logwindow might actually work better.
+ Added transfer speed to file transfer log messages.
+ Changed all dialogboxes to use MS or Win95 3D-controls. No more BWCC.DLL.
+ Data connection now uses the RFC959 default local port, ie. local port 20 if the command connection uses 21. Should make some firewalls more happy.
+ Added the FTP command SIZE. Should make Netscape happy (so it can tell filesize on transfer).
- Fixed client message in case 'anonymous' is disabled.
- Fixed various dialogbox errors (text, formatting).
- Non-anonymous users can now also delete 'read only' files.
- Fixed logscreen: It will now do automatic horizontal scrolling when the cursor is moved.
- Fixed bug that caused filenames like '/c:' to be seen as relative.


1.1i (September 18, 1995)
=========================
+ Change of address in all the documents.
+ The try-out version will continue to work after October 15th. 1995 (v1.1h won't).
- Fixed bug in renaming long file names.
- Fixed bug that caused rare GPF's with some firewall proxy clients.


1.1h
====
+ Added switch to explicitely disable long file/directory names in Windows 95.
- Fixed a bug causing garbage to appear in some cases if a directory listing of an empty directory was made


1.1g
====
- Fixed bug in making directories for Win3.1 and WFW3.11.
- Fixed bug in deleting long file names under Win95.


1.1f
====
+ Windows 95 long file names are supported. Serv-U auto-detects the presence of Win95.
+ The current number of users is displayed in the window title.
+ The 'password' checks for anonymous users can be disabled.
+ MS-DOS or Windows programs can be started remotely, using the SITE command EXEC. The EXEC mechanism is also part of the regular access rules.
+ When the server is stopped while there are users logged in, a dialogbox will pop up to confirm the action.
+ Options to the LIST and NLST commands are handled (ie. 'ls -la' like some clients send to the server will produce output).
+ The FTP commands APPE (=append) and STOU (=store unique) are now supported.
+ Data type 'L8' (=local type 8 bits per byte) is now supported.
+ Server is not restarted any more if maximum number of users or time-out values are changed.
+ Anonymous users no longer see hidden files.
+ Drives are checked for accessability before usage, so no longer the 'retry - ignore' dialogboxes.
+ Info on the WinSock socket stack is shown on startup.
+ Made Serv-U more tolerant for firewalls using proxy servers that mix PASV and PORT commands.
- The bug causing Serv-U to beep when it could not log to screen has been fixed (actually a MS-Windows bug).
- Fixed bug causing false dir listings for 'dir .'.
- Fixed bug that caused XCWD, XRMD, and XMKD to malfunction.


1.1e
====
+ Anonymous users no longer see 'hidden' files.
+ Paths are now reported back with a leading '/'. This is to ensure  more compatibility with the UNIX format and to make a number of Macintosh FTP clients even happier.
+ The start-up message of Serv-U now reports the socket stack it is running on.
+ When a user/group has a password it is now shown as '***********' in 'setup - users/groups'. Deleting this deletes the password entry for that user/group, ie. it no longer has a password. 
+ Spaces are now allowed in user names and passwords.
+ Stopping the server is logged (if logging to file is switched on).
+ Paths are now consistently reported back using '/' instead of '\', to be more in line with the UNIX way of working. Mac FTP clients need this to function properly.
+ A leading '/' or '\' in front of a full pathname is ignored, ie. '/c:/util' is equivalent to 'c:\util'. This allows for UNIX style changes of directory, and enables WWW browsers to change drives.
+ The response to an incorrect anonymous password is changed to be more informative.
+ Displaying a file when the client changes directory is supported.
+ When 'setup - logging - FTP commands' is switched on it no longer shows passwords, 'XXXXX' instead.
- Fixed a rather nasty bug in the security system.
- Fixed bug that assigned random passwords to users that should have no password (a situation found in users belonging to a group where the group password should also be the user's password).
- Very long pathnames are now supported correctly.


1.1 (March 19, 1995)
====================
+ Added lots of logging. 
+ The SYST command now replies with the code for a UNIX system. This is because some clients use it to determine the format of directory listings.
+ Time-out values for idle/hung connections are now part of server setup. 
+ Drastically increased packet time-out for data transfer, now set at 5 minutes (was 30 seconds). Should be sufficient to allow transfer even on bad connections. 
+ Log messages for failed data transfers now have a specification showing why. 
+ Changed the HELP response to make WS_FTP work properly with Serv-U. 
+ Added support for transfer to/from ports (PRN: AUX: LPTx: and COMx:). 
+ Made a work-around for FTP Inc.'s WinSock stack. This stack does not handle SO_LINGER properly on closing a socket, causing 'data channel in use' errors. 
+ Changed response messages to file transfers, only the filename is shown now, not the path name. 
+ Added a retry period for the server to come online. This should solve problems with socket stacks that do not allow to re-use a port immediately after closing it. 
+ Changed the timing of the '150-' response message for PASV transfers. It is now sent after the data connection is established instead of at the time of a transfer command. 
+ The listening socket will now automatically be restarted when killed by the socket stack. Some stacks kill listening sockets without reason (Trumpet for one). 
+ Username 'FTP' is now synonymous to 'ANONYMOUS'. 
+ Clients that connect but never log in are now kicked off the system after 5 minutes. 
+ User can now select the try-out method: Fully functional with contacts to my permission server, or, crippled but no permission server contacts. 
+ Installed selectable path mechanism for anonymous: Either absolute paths (like a regular user) allowing for drive changes, or paths relative to the home directory (needed for WWW browsers). 
+ Changed registration key to work with user/company name instead of IP number. Every time Serv-U is started it tries to read the key from a file KEY.TXT.  Registered version displays the key in the "About" box and in reply to the FTP HELP command. 
+ Changed the RETR and STOR replies (used for GET and PUT). They are now conform the average UNIX system. This makes WS_FTP more happy, so it shows a progress bar while downloading.
- Fixed some spelling errors in messages. Fixed logging to screen for time-out messages. Added log message in case limit of no. of users is reached. Added log message when server is (re)started. 
- Fixed bug that caused path for anonymous users with root as home directory to be reported without a '\' at beginning. The same bug caused absolute paths in CWD to be processed incorrectly. 
- Fixed bug that caused random truncation of PUT files in combination with some clients. 
- Fixed bug that allowed users to get 'dir' listings for paths with explicitly no access set to them. 
- Fixed bug causing 'dir' with absolute path name to go wrong. 
- Fixed a bug that made RMD (=remove directory) fail if the directory was on a drive other than the active drive. 
- Fixed bug in very long directory listings (>64K data). 


1.0 (February 7, 1995)
======================
* Initial release.
